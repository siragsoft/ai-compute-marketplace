# AI Compute Marketplace on BlockDAG

🚀 A decentralized marketplace for buying and selling AI compute power, built on BlockDAG to ensure secure, transparent transactions.

---

## 🌟 Overview

AI model training requires massive compute power, which is often centralized and costly.  
This platform democratizes compute access by connecting:

- 🖥 **Providers** with idle GPUs/CPUs to monetize.
- 🤖 **AI researchers & startups** needing affordable compute.
- 🛡 **BlockDAG smart contracts** that ensure secure escrow & trustless payments.
- ✅ **IPFS** for decentralized task data storage.

---

## ✨ Features

✅ Provider listings with pricing & availability  
✅ Escrowed payments via BlockDAG smart contracts  
✅ Off-chain compute task execution with on-chain proof submission  
✅ Automatic verification & payment release  
✅ Reputation system for providers & buyers  
✅ Decentralized storage via IPFS for datasets / model checkpoints
